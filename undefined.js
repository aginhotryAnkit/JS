// 'undefined' :- undefined live a place holder its hold the place of the variable 
//              untill the variable is not aissgin a value of itself;

// 'not defiend' :-  not defined is error that is endicate that variable try to access is 
//                 is not defined yet and not in a Heap Memory. or Laxical Space;

// error look like that [ReferenceError: x is not defined]

// 'null' :- dont confused about the null because null is a value which is assign to a variable
//         when the user want to store nothing in variable, It is often used to initialize a
//         variable to an "empty" or "unknown" state;


//Note :- Null is endicate the absence or empty state of the var and undefiend denote that the value
//variable not has been intilize or declare or asssign yet.
