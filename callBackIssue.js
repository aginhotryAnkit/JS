// /**
//  * Now there is a trust issue with the settime out function in the given example
//  * we have declare a callback function which is need to run after the 2 seconds
//  * but function did't run after the 2 second because after the settimeout function
//  * there is while loop witch is run by 5 second and when program is run a call function
//  * is register in the web api and after the that rest of the code means while loop
//  * is running by 5 second after but in that time settimeout function need to be executed
//  * but did't executed. The reason behind not executed is that there is an callback queue 
//  * and event loop in the js environment event loop is keep checking if the callstack is empty
//  * then it will get the callback function from the callback queue and and put inside the
//  * callstack and callstack is executed it. here because callstack is still executed the
//  * GEC [global execution context]. and when the whole code inside the GEC is run
//  * then GEC pop off the callstack and and at that time event loop check callstack is empty
//  * it will quickly pick the callback from the the callback queue and put the callback function
//  * inside the callstack and callstack executed callback function.
//  * 
//  * that how the whole program is being executed.
