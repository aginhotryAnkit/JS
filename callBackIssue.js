/**
 * Now there is a trust issue with the settime out function in the given example
 * we have decalre a callback function which is need to run after the 2 seconds
 * but function did't run after the 2 second becase after the settimeout function
 * there is while loop witch is run by 5 second and when program is run a callfunction
 * is registed in the web api and after the that rest of the code means while loop
 * is running by 5 second after but in that time settimeout function need to be executeed
 * but did't executed. The reson behild not executed is that there is an callback queue 
 * and event loop in the js enviroment event loop is keep checking if the callsack is empty
 * then it will get the callback function from the callback queue and and put inside the
 * callstack and callstack is executed it. here because callstack is still executed the
 * GEC [global execulation contaxt]. and when the whole code inside the GEC is run
 * then GEC pop off the callstack and and at that time event loop check callstack is empty
 * it will quickly pick the callback from the the callback queueu and put the callback function
 * inside the callstack and callstack executed callback function.
 * 
 * that how the whole program is being executed.
